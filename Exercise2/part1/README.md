# Part 1

The 3 implementations are basically what we discussed in the previous lecture, in the NESTED_VECTOR implementation the memory for the matrix gets allocated by an std::vector of std::vector's like in Exercise1. In the two CONTIGUOUS_... implementations the memory of the matrix gets allocated with only 1 vector of the size n*n, therefore its a contiguous memory block. The difference of this two implementations is how we access an element of the Matrix. INDIRECTION uses an std::vector to store the address of the 1st element of each line, the MULTIPLICATION implementation just computes the address of the i-th line by multiplying i*n.
We already saw last week that the contiguous with indirection should outperform the other implementation. The contiguous memory block should save a lot of branch misses but we already saw that the multiplication cost is higher than the branch misses cost. The indirection table saves those 2 multiplications for each row which therefore is the fastest.
